Clojure solutions to Advent of Code 2019 (https://adventofcode.com/2019/about). I started late but I'm planning to finish around Jan 10. I am using this year's competition as an opportunity to learn Clojure better, in preparation for some personal projects I would like to do in this language.

Code files for each day are in /src, associated text files in /resources.
