# advent2019

Clojure solutions to Advent of Code 2019 (https://adventofcode.com/2019/about), still a work in progress. I am using this year's competition as an opportunity to learn Clojure better, in preparation for some personal projects I would like to do in this language.

Code files for each day are in /src, associated text files in /resources.
