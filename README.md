# advent2019

Update 1/12/20: Semester has now started, so progress will be much slower (if I can do anything at all).


Clojure solutions to Advent of Code 2019 (https://adventofcode.com/2019/about), still a work in progress. I am using this year's competition as an opportunity to learn Clojure better, in preparation for some personal projects I would like to do in this language.

Code files for each day are in /src, associated text files in /resources.
